# Colour_Recognition_and_prediction
This is an OpenCV project which recognises the colour in the image and predicts the percentage of colour. The aim of this project is to help colourblind people see which part of their vision is not able to show the particular colour they have specified.
Right now it can only distinguish blue, green and red from an image. 

Working on more colours.
